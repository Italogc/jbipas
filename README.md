This repo is made from me , to people who want more tweaks for iOS 13 to upcoming ios 14 jailbroken devices. This repo is made just for cydia and I will let you guys know if I have open source help from other friendly developers that I can trust to have to work with me.

Cydia is a software distribution platform, similar to the iTunes App Store. You can download so-called “tweaks” which serve to extend your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch on a functional level. Furthermore, you can install all sorts of icon themes, wallpapers, ringtones and specialized Cydia apps.

I also can't wait for the next package manager called capsule for ios 13 devices.Its better then sileo.

Repositories, or repos for short, are like add-on packs for Cydia that contain extra tweaks and apps. These can range from simple apps that change your font to mods that give you full root access to your iPhone's innermost workings.

Here are the defuslt cydia sources you should have already on your ios device after jailbreaking your idevice...
BigBoss & Planet-iPhone. You can get a lot of paid apps for free under BigBoss repo. ...
ModMyi. Just like BigBoss, ModMyi do host a lot of apps, tweaks, themes, and games. ...
Ste Packaging. ...
iSpazio. ...
Telesphoreo Tangelo. ...
ZodTTD & MacCiti.
